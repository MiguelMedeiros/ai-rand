# Pubky Knowledge Base

## Core Concepts

### PKARR (Public Key Addressable Resource Records)
PKARR is a system that bridges the gap between DNS and peer-to-peer overlay networks. It allows self-issued public keys to function as sovereign, publicly addressable domains. Key features:
- Simplicity in DNS and P2P network integration
- Sovereignty through public key-based domains
- Accessibility to anyone with a private key
- Scalability and resilience using Mainline DHT
- Compatibility with existing applications through DNS over HTTPS (DoH)

### Homeservers
Homeservers are decentralized data stores in the Pubky network that:
- Improve censorship resistance
- Prevent single entity control
- Allow users to redefine their data location
- Support public and private data
- Enable data retrieval through RESTful API
- Facilitate user data control and credible exit

### Credible Exit
The ability to leave a platform without losing:
- Access to data
- Identity
- Connections
- Full user control and portability

### Censorship Resistance
Pubky addresses censorship through:
- Flexible hosting with trusted servers
- Decentralized identity using self-issued public keys
- Data portability and redundancy
- User-controlled moderation
- Multiple independent data stores

### Semantic Social Graph
A system that:
- Tags connections with meaningful metadata
- Uses weighted relationships
- Enables user-centric personalization
- Supports decentralization
- Facilitates content curation and discovery

## Architecture
